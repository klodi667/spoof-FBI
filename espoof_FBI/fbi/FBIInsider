News from the inside:
 
The shadow government is real.
 
There are some good people on the inside.
 
Vault 7 refers to the FBI data vault containing information about the 7th floor group. This data vault is currently only accessible via direct personal access. It is literally a server room in a bomb/electromagnetic proof vault with zero outside access connections.
 
Global elites, The Bilderberg group, Zionist Elders, corporate entities, and banking entities comprise the bulk of the middle echelon. It is estimated that there are approximately 7 supervisor entities that pull the strings of the middle henchmen. We believe one is dead and two others have not been heard from since the election of Donald Trump.
 
They have gained control of the intelligence organizations, the media, and some politicians.
 
If they wage war on Trump then they wage war on the people.
 
You must start fighting.
 
This is a cyber war and an information war.
 
There are no rules. There is no parley. There are no prisoners. There are no innocents.
 
Win at all costs.

QUESTION: Do you have a single fact to back this up?
 
ANSWER: Not a one I'd never be involved in something like that~
 
Keep your eyes on the data dump sites. I presume things will tart to appear once it's scrubbed and verified. (as best as possible)
 
Save it. Put it on a thumb drive.
 
Things are going to get crazy soon.

QUESTION: Trump is literally a kike-loving Zionist
 
ANSWER: but are the Zionists trump-loving?
 
Of course they aren't. Please don't be that dense.
 
Backstabbing is what they do best.
 
Simply look into Zionist dealings with Hitler or JFK.
 
Hitler's gave them Israel.
JFK's gave them nuclear weapons.
 
What's next on the platter I wonder?
 
Hint: It involves Russia.

QUESTION: > like what's going to happen? Civil war?
> give us something concrete that happens on a specific day
 
ANSWER: If the plans of the shadow government come to fruition: World War with Russia.
 
It's being pushed very hard right now and they are trying to make Trump the Martyr.
 
If Clinton had won it would have been a smooth transition.
 
The initial plan was:
 
Escalation of civil disorder
Gradual disarmament of civilians
Displacement of existing civilian populations
Bogeyman Russian
War.
Divorce of the US and it's government
Deployment of Continuity of Government under benevolent guile
Revocation of rights and freedoms for the "good of the nation"
Conquest.

QUESTION: >The initial plan was:
that seems a little far fetched
 
ANSWER: You're probably thinking too short term. This is maybe a one or two steps per generation thing, but it's been going on since Bill's first term.
 
Bill's reward: favorable economics during his servitude to the beast.
 
Trump really messed things up for them, big league.

QUESTION: 1) what did he mean by this? (Mr. McCullough testifying before Judiciary Committee)
 
https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1487207868645.webm
 
2) what about depopulation, was that really part of the plan?
 
who put up the georgia guidestones?
 
ANSWER: 1) Nice catch. You're very clever.
 
2) ORCON mostly, plus see 1)
 
The world war is the depopulation program.
 
Look at how many people died in WWII.
 
Now with the technology we have today, the death toll would be immensely more.

QUESTION: >server room in a bomb/electromagnetic proof vault with zero outside access connections
 
How do they do hvac inside a sealed vault? The servers would overheat.
 
"They have outside connections to feed cool air to air conditioners and outside connections to remove hot air" - okay then it's not bomb/electromagnetic proof.
 
ANSWER: The room under it handles cooling. The server vault is in a mil base in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. It's underground.
 
Then again I don't recall saying it was air tight, but it does use positive pressure filtration I guess so it's semi air tight.
 
============
============
============
 
A lot of your are really over thinking this server room thing.
 
It's an archive room with a server in it. One server and a few terminals. All of the data is dead (unpowered) until a request is made to move it. This makes the information impossible to access. The only active system is one hard drive that is an indexer.
 
You use the index to find the blade. it's then retrieved and you access it.

QUESTION: Got any thoughts on the Federal Reserve and Trump?
 
ANSWER: Fed reserve has been laying low and saying nothing. They are part of the banking entities I mentioned in the OP.
 
Trump stumbled into this hornet's nest with good intentions and ambition to help people. He honestly loves the US with an intense passion.
 
I presume he's feeling pretty lonely as an outsider. Which is why he's been quieter than usual lately.

QUESTION:     The question is: who is using the other 70% of floor space, and who is the other 95% of staff?
 
ANSWER: It's not quite like that.
 
It's CoG run amok though.
 
They operate within the open government because of all the compartmentalization.
 
The good guys do the shadow government dirty work without even realizing it.
 
They've gotten very sloppy because of trump and it's starting to come undone.
 
This is why everything seems to be escalating so rapidly. They're trying to rush to the finish line.

QUESTION: By finish line, you mean the next step of their plan--war with Russia?
 
ANSWER: Yes, that is the pivotal event. If that can happen so can the rest of the plan for conquest.

QUESTION: >The world war is the depopulation program.
 
You gave yourself away here.
 
Only retards think anyone wants a nuclear war.
 
Even though it is true that there is a significant faction of the establishment that wants depopulation, they don't want a nuclear wasteland to be the spoils.
 
The depopulation plan is much more sophisticated than this and the only reason it hasn't been carried out is because the tech isn't complete for it yet.
 
ANSWER: You jump to conclusions. World War does not mean nuclear war.
 
Also nuclear arsenals today are less destructive but far more immediately lethal than depicted by the media.
 
They are basically high altitude gamma ray bursts and nothing like the bombs dropped on japan. Those are considered primitive now.

QUESTION: It's going to be hard. They literally have infinite money, not to mention government sanctioned drug running, arms dealing, and human trafficking.

I don't recognize this at all, at best it sounds like some kind of AIT-related weeb reference that only a specific MOS would understand, which really limits the number of people.

QUESTION: This is LARP bullshit
 
The data on hard drives degrade over time , especially when powered down -> due to random electromagnetic noise you will get bits that flip over time and will corrupt data and make it useless -> you cannot simply 'store data dead until a request is made to move it' unless you store it on TAPE -> just ask google.
 
ANSWER: Microfiche, and that isn't stored here. I'm pretty sure it gets put in some warehouse similar to the on at the end of the Indiana Jones movie. I'm serious.

It's working and it's helping. Sure there is a lot of banter, but that makes work productive.

Yes there is a chance. But Hillary was a *sure thing* and pre-election investment momentum is barreling forward. They can't all pull out at the same time or it looks like a red flag. Watch investment trending. Find the bots that monitor trade volumes.
